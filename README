AP CSA final project: text based minesweeper
--------------------------------------------
This is a text based minesweeper game, written in Java using Netbeans. Requires 
an ANSI compliant terminal and jnativehook for keyboard input.

Building
I use Maven to build the project and manage the dependency. The commands I used
for the project are as follows (assuming the commands are run in the project
root directory):
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/<result jar file>

Running
The program must be run in an ANSI terminal, otherwise the formatting will not 
work. Because of the jnativehook dependency, the program is not platform
independent. Due to the dependency, this program can only run correctly with
X11 under Linux.
The default lines and columns the game uses is hardcoded. If you want to use the
terminal's sizes, pass the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables when
executing the program.
$ LINES=$LINES COLUMNS=$COLUMNS java -jar ...
